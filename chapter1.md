## More movies 

In the previous exercise, you saw a dataset about movies. In this exercise, we'll have a look at yet another dataset about movies!

A dataset with a selection of movies, `movie_selection`, is available in the workspace.

*** =instructions
- Check out the structure of `movie_selection`.
- Select movies with a rating of 5 or higher. Assign the result to `good_movies`.
- Use `plot()` to  plot `good_movies$Run` on the x-axis, `good_movies$Rating` on the y-axis and set `col` to `good_movies$Genre`.

*** =hint
- Use `str()` for the first instruction.
- For the second instruction, you should use `...[movie_selection$Rating >= 5, ]`.
- For the plot, use `plot(x = ..., y = ..., col = ...)`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# Pre-load a package in the workspace
library(ggplot2)

# You can prepare the data before the student starts:

# You can also clean up data so that it's not available in the student's workspace anymore:

```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Make ggplot2 available to use
#library(ggplot2)

# Make the dataset diamonds available to use
#diamonds <- diamonds

# Check out the structure of diamonds
#str(diamonds)
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Make ggplot2 available to use
library(ggplot2)

# Make the dataset diamonds available to use
diamonds <- diamonds

# Check out the structure of diamonds
str(diamonds)

```

# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# testwhat R package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/testwhat/wiki

# Test whether the function str is called with the correct argument, object

# Test the object, good_movies
# Notice that we didn't define any feedback here, this will cause automatically 
# generated feedback to be given to the student in case of an incorrect submission
test_object("good_movies")

# Test whether the student correctly used plot()
# Again, we use the automatically generated feedback here
test_function("plot", args = "x")
test_function("plot", args = "y")
test_function("plot", args = "col")

# Alternativeley, you can use test_function() like this

# It's always smart to include the following line of code at the end of your SCTs
# It will check whether executing the student's code resulted in an error,
